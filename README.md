This `kv_storage_shared_preferences` package provides a concrete Flutter implementation of the `KVStorageService` interface within the [**Flutter News App Full Source Code Toolkit**](https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code). It leverages the popular `shared_preferences` package to offer a persistent key-value storage mechanism suitable for simple data across Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Web, and Windows platforms. This package wraps the underlying `shared_preferences` plugin with a defined interface and robust error handling based on the `kv_storage_service` contract, ensuring consistent and reliable local data management.

## ‚≠ê Feature Showcase: Cross-Platform Persistent Storage

This package offers a comprehensive set of features for managing local key-value data using `shared_preferences`.

<summary><strong>üß± Core Functionality</strong></summary>

### üöÄ `KVStorageService` Implementation
- **`KVStorageSharedPreferences` Class:** A concrete implementation of the `KVStorageService` interface, providing a standardized way to interact with `shared_preferences`.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Utilizes `shared_preferences` for underlying storage, supporting Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Web, and Windows.
- **Singleton Access:** Provides a convenient singleton pattern (`getInstance`) for easy and consistent access to the storage instance throughout the application.

### üåê Comprehensive Data Operations
- **Read/Write Operations:** Implements methods for reading and writing `String`, `bool`, `int`, and `double` values.
- **Data Deletion:** Includes methods for deleting specific keys (`delete`) and clearing all stored data (`clearAll`).

### üõ°Ô∏è Standardized Error Handling
- **Custom `StorageException` Propagation:** Throws specific `StorageException` subtypes (e.g., `StorageWriteException`, `StorageReadException`, `StorageTypeMismatchException`, `StorageInitializationException`) as defined in `kv_storage_service`, ensuring predictable and consistent error management across the application layers.

### üíâ Interface-Driven Design
- **Decoupled Logic:** By implementing the `KVStorageService` interface, this package ensures that application logic remains decoupled from the specific `shared_preferences` implementation, allowing for future flexibility and testability.

> **üí° Your Advantage:** You get a meticulously designed, production-quality `shared_preferences` implementation that simplifies local data management, ensures type safety, provides robust error handling, and offers cross-platform compatibility. This package accelerates development by providing a solid foundation for persistent local data storage.
